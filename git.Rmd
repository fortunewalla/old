*1. Recommended: Every repository should include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.*

**2. Create a new repository on the command line**
```
$echo # www-blue >> README.md
% Usually done inside a new directory.
$git init
% Adding file for the commit.
$git add README.md
$git add -A
% Committing with comments.
$git commit -m "first commit"
% Add the location to push files to
$git remote add origin https://github.com/fortunewalla/www-blue.git
% Send files from local directory to Remote Master directory.
$git push -u origin master
```

**3. Push an existing repository from the command line**
```
$git remote add origin https://github.com/fortunewalla/www-blue.git
$git push -u origin master
```

**4. How to protect email address?**
```
$git config user.email "username@users.noreply.github.com"
```
Confirm that you have set your email address correctly with the following command.

```
$git config user.email

# username@users.noreply.github.com
```

**5. Caching password in memory**
```
$git config --global credential.helper cache
```
Default time in memory is 15 minutes.

Setting a custom timeout in seconds.
```
$git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
```

**6. Misc.**

Most changes occur locally & then synced to the 'master' repo of the project.

'Pro Git' textbook.

gitorious.org (free hosting), gitlab.com (host locally), bitbucket.org (cloud hosted free), stash (buy & install locally), sourcetreeapp.com (free)

Every commit has a unique ID. Date is When you made the commit. Not when you made added it to other repos.

**7. LaTeX Test**

This a sample equation in LaTeX i.e. $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ So what do you think of it?


$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$
